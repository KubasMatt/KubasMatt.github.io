### Member (FL23)
I joined IEEE at Washington University to continue my involvement in clubs that are usually very welcoming and good group of folks, and I was not wrong. Immediately when I joined in the Fall, I was welcomed with two large events that happen every fall, the _Black Box Competition_ and the _Vertigo Academic Rave_ where IEEE builds and manges the dance floor. 

As a member I was able to compete in the 2023 Analog Black Box competition, hosted at Southern Illinois University in Edwardsville, where it was my first time trying to piece together a circuit that I couldn't see. For the analog part, you were given a box with 4-5 connections to different nodes in a simple circuit with 4-6 components, which consisted of 2 non-linear components (diode or transistor) and the rest linear (resistor, capacitor, inductor). This was extremely difficult and fun, and I was able to win 3rd place in the competition.

### President (YR24)
Once I was elected president, my goal was to create a set of approximately 30 times (5x6 grid), that were robust and easily created. The previous tiles were almost all completely destroyed, with the connectors failing and the physical construction and structure also failing.
