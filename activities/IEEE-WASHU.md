### Member (FL23)
I joined IEEE at Washington University to continue my involvement in clubs that are usually very welcoming and good group of folks, and I was not wrong. Immediately when I joined in the Fall I was welcomed with two large events that happen every fall, the _Black Box Competition_ and the _Vertigo Academic Rave_ where IEEE builds and manges the dance floor. 

### President (YR24)
Once I was elected president, my goal was to create a set of approximately 30 times (5x6 grid), that were robust and easily created. The previous tiles were almost all completely destroyed, with the connectors failing and the physical construction and structure also failing.
