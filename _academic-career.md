# My University Career
## Illinois Wesleyan University

Below is a list of relevant classes that were fundamental to the application of my knowledge. To see all my classes please see my <a href="https://kubasmatt.github.io/documents/transcripts/IWU-Unofficial-Transcript.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unofficial Transcript</a>.

- Modern Physics (with Lab)
    - An introduction to how the world really works with topics like Neronian Mechanics, Quantum Mechanics, Optics, and more
    - Taught the basics of how to program in _LABview_ and how to use electronics equipment 
    - Reinforced good lab notebook writing tactics to create a in depth and concise lab notebook
- Electronics (with Lab)
    - An introduction to basic electronic and electrical components and how to intuitively solve circuits problems
    - Continued skill development in how to use devices found in electronics labs like oscilloscopes, multimeter, function generators, and more
- Materials Physics (with Lab)
    - Lab course looking into the material properties of different solids including stress and strain, crystalline structures, quantum level behavior, and more
    - Labs included stress and strain of metals, photo-electric effect, and quantized conductance in gold wire
- Optical Physics (with Lab)
    - Introduction to signal analysis, like the convolutions and Fourier Transforms, optical properties of materials, spectroscopy, interferometers, and more
    - The lab included learning the skill-set of setting up and proper handling of optical equipment, the use of spacial light modulators (SLMs) used in an interferometer, to measure interference patterns of light, creation of holograms, and more
- Quantum Information Science
    - An introduction to the theory behind quantum computers, their current structures, and potential use in the future
- Intermediate Experimental Methods (Lab)
    - This is purely a lab class, that taught us how to work as a team of mechanical, electrical, and software engineers, to design a chassis, design the circuitry, and create the software (in _LABview_) to control the system. The system was a temperature control lab, where a Peltier module was used to lower the temperature to a certain point, and it was my job as the electrical lead to help others understand the electrical system and work with the other teams to deliver the finished product.
- Electricity and Magnetism
    - Waves


## Washington University in St. Louis

List of many the classes I took at Washington University in Electrical Engineering. To see a full list please see my <a href="https://kubasmatt.github.io/documents/transcipts/WashU-Unofficial-Transcript.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unofficial Transcript</a>.

    - Designed a custom chassis that is 3D printable and easy to assemble with minimal hardware and assembly


# Before University
#### Carl Sandburg High School

I went to high school and graduated, with high marks too. Trust me bro.

I completed all required courses while also being apart of:
- The concert band as a percussionist
- Taking a CAD design class to learn the basic of architectural drawings and learn to use CAD softwares like AutoCAD and Inventor
- Taking Auto Tech class, where I learned how to disassemble and reassemble a gasoline motor, and other basic car maintenance
